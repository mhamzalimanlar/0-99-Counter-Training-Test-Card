A development and test board was designed using Altium Designer. It is driven by a ULN2003 with 2 inputs through a PC8817C optoisolator and 2 outputs with a 12V relay. The board includes a voltage divider structure with a voltage meter circuit, which is set up using a 10K potentiometer. The board also includes a 4-digit seven-segment display, a DS18B temperature sensor, and RS232 serial communication with a MAX232. The board is controlled by a PIC16F876 microcontroller.
